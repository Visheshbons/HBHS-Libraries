# HBHS Libraries

This is the official HBHS school library web app! \
This has not (yet!) been implemented in school, but should be ready by the First of June! \
We are looking forward to what this could bring to our school. \

## How to Use

This does not have a public web application, and is built to run locally on the library computers. \
This makes running our code a littler more complicated.

First, clone this repo locally using 
```
git fetch "https://github.com/Visheshbons/HBHS-Libraries.git"
```

Then, go to your terminal, and run
```
npm i
```

This is to install all the dependancies. \
Now, you can run this code using 
```
nodemon index.js
```

Enjoy!
